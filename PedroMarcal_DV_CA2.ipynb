Compare the performance of Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* search algorithm, referring to heuristics, to find the shortest path to the problem by implementing both algorithms programmatically and comparing the solutions generated in Mark-down. Refer to the complexity of the algorithms and compare the actual time it takes for the solutions to be processed.\n",

Examples of graphs being used to solve problem is, when you have to connect to point A from point X, for various reasons, such as connecting train stations with the shortest path or connecting points to create a network. \n",
